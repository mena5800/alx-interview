# Coin Change Problem

## Objective
To find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount using a given list of coin denominations.

## Approach
### Greedy Algorithm
- Suitable for specific sets of coin denominations.
- Not always guarantees an optimal solution.

### Dynamic Programming
- Uses overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
- Ensures an optimal solution for any set of coin denominations.

## Files
- `coin_change.py`: Contains the implementation of the coin change problem solution.

## Usage
Ensure Python 3.4.3 is installed. Make the script executable and run it with the required arguments.
